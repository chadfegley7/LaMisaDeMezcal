    <p id="mezcalInfo">
      Mezcal is a distilled alcholic beverage made from any type of agave plant native to Mexico. The agave grows in most parts of Mexico, though most Mezcal is made in Oaxaca. Today, mezcal is still made from the heart of the agave plant called the p√≠na, much the same way it was 200 years ago, in most places.

      If you like tequila but wish it had more oomph, it's time to dig into the wider world of mezcal, the category of Oaxacan agave spirits that includes tequila but also other more smoky and brawny elixirs. Though traditionally drank straight, mezcal's intense smokiness and slight savory edge make it especially compelling in cocktails. Herbal, spicy, tart, and bittersweet, these 15 playful drinks show everything mezcal has to offer.
